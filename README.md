How to import weather data: 
  - Assign weather data from the closest weather station.
        - Is weather data always pulled from the closest weather station?
        - Would it be more accurate to assign a temperature based on trip partitions?
  - Choose a time interval and update weather data only after every time interval



TODO: 2 November

  - Pepe: Weather data âœ…
  - Simon: Visualizations âœ…, Separate journeys âœ…

**NEXT MEETING**: thursday 9 november 10:00 

TODO: 9 November:
  - Simon: MobilityDB setup âœ…
  - Narmina: Anomaly detection techniques âœ…
  - Konok: Local notebook (jupyter) âœ…

WEATHER DATA: 
What weather data are we going to incorporate in the analysis? 
- ``Temperature``
- ```Humidity```
- ````Snowfall````
- ```Rain```

**NEXT MEETING**: thursday 16 november 10:00 


NEXT STEPS: 

Feature extraction: 
- Labeling the anomalies


 1. Data cleaning ( output: .csv)
	2.	Database creation
	3.	Add features to the DB
	4.	Feature extraction
	5.	Data mining algorithms

TASKS: 
- Connect Kaggle to local postgres (Simon) âœ…
- Adding extra features to the DB (Pepe) âœ…
- Correlation, heat map, feature extraction (Konok) âœ…
- preprocessing (Narmina) âœ…


**NEXT MEETING**: Sunday 19 november 10:00 


**NEXT MEETING:** Thursday 23, November (after going to the Data Mining lab)

Classification will be important for the stream outlier detection part of the project

Feature extraction:
- Difference between two sensors
- Temperature categorization

Type portability:
- Numerical to categorical (temperature values)

Descriptive Analytics:
- Narmina has performed sampling rate (it varies)
- Simon has looked into segment speed
- Pepe has looked into the bounding box (values not contained in the Belgium geom)

Noisy entries:
- Konok mentioned binning to clean the noisy entries

Distance:
- Distance to weather pull sensors can be included in the outlier detection analysis

Clustering:
- Could be useful to clean data (if a data point doesn't end up in a cluster it could be considered an outlier)

Topics to be investigated:
- Narmina: Classification and model validation data preparation
- Konok: Clustering
- Simon: Frequent patterns and association rule mining
- Pepe: Outlier mining


**Basic research questions:**
1. Absolute number of times the temperatures are outside the boundaries for each vehicle_id (maybe there are more for one -> problem with a veh_id).\
	SIMON: âœ… Look at R1.ipynb in exports

2.  Locations of the places where the temperatures are outside of the boundaries.\
	SIMON: âœ… R2

3.  Look at the rpm values for when the temperatures are outside the boundaries\
   	NARMINA: âœ… R3

4. Are there specific times of day, days of the week, or months where temperature anomalies are more frequent?\
   	KONOK: âœ… Look at R4_R5.ipynb in exports

8. Look at the speed and find anomalies\
   	SIMON: âœ… R8

9. Look at the internal temperature sensor values that exceed certain differences with the ambient temperature\
	PEPE: ðŸ”„ working on it

10. Look at the differences between the pairs of sensors. Look at other attributes when they deviate from each other \
	PEPE: ðŸ”„ working on it


**Ideas on things for the stream bonus task**
- Algorithm that checks incoming locations if the speed is within boundaries, it flags incorrect location
- Algorithm that checks incoming temperatures and checks the duration of occurrences when the temperature is outside of boundaries and then reports
